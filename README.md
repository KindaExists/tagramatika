# TaGramatika

by Clyde Ambroz Acyatan, Dominic Lawrence Bermudez, Ehren Castillo, & Eoghaine Czeriel Saavedra.

This repository contains all the main coding files used for my group's demo of our project titled "TaGramatika", a Tagalog Grammar-checking tool.

This project was developed for the accomplishment of the CS 10 subject of the University of The Philippines-Diliman.
